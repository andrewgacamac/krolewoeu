# Business Architecture Document - Warsaw Forest Properties

## Project Overview

This document serves as the comprehensive repository of all background information, research insights, and strategic planning used to create the Warsaw Forest Properties website. The website is designed to position our firm as the exclusive specialist in forest properties within the greater Warsaw region, with particular focus on Królewo and surrounding areas, serving sophisticated international clients from Western Europe.

### Updated Business Focus
